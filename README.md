# Hannah's Pocketbooks

My mom owns a store and I wanted to make her a website so that people could visit it.  (https://hannahspocketbooks.github.io)

I actually created a github account in her name first and did all the work on there.

I have created a few websites before but this time I wanted to try and experiment with a template and I found this interesting site that would allow you to make changes
as if it were a google slide and then code the html for it.

I messed around with these features for a good 5 hours or so to just see how the html would look and then I eventually created her a website that in my opinion look 
pretty good and is far beyong what I would have been able to accomplish in five hours without the template.

Depending on how the business goes, it might get to the point where I would be able to add features such as being able to purchase items in the store online. 

I hope it actually reaches to this point because not only did I have a lot of fun doing this, but it felt really good to be able to give back to my mom, 
especially with something computer science related.
